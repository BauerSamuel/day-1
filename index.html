    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>I'm Samuel.</p>
    <h2>What did I do before codeworks?</h2>
    <p>
        Before codeworks I was working as a chemist. I didn't enjoy the repetitiveness of being a chemist. Every day
        was
        the same thing for me as a chemist. So I decided I would leave the field and take a break for a year. I took a
        gap year and decided to teach math in China for a year to take a break and decide what I will pursue. After my
        year in China, I settled on software developement. Codeworks was the way for that to happen for me. I studied
        computer science for a while in college so I found that I really enjoy this field. Now I'm excited to work as a
        developer and solve problems for people with their software, websites, databases, etc.

    <h2>What I hope to get out of the course?</h2>
    <p>
        I am very much in to more "back-end" developement stuff, but I am not so interested or experienced in
        "front-end" development. It's kind of a weakness for me and I want to really get better and learn a lot about
        this part of development. I enjoy working on algorithms though usually I suck at writing good ones. So I hope
        here I can train my brain to solve algorithms more quickly and more efficiently. I hope to learn all of the
        practical ways to develop. In university, we learned lots of academic stuff on this topic, lots of theoretical
        stuff but not much about how to work in this field. So I really think this course will show me how to use my
        software skills to help an employer and not just to do research in a university.
